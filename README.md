  ## What is the Matcher ?
 
The Matcher is a Python library that was created to parse hash sequences.
It can take two (2) strings and analyze them.
  
If all goes well, you have put the two strings to analyze,
it will return:

   > The sequences are the same
  
  if the sequences are not the same it will return in this case:
  
  > The sequences are not the same

   ### Requirements
   
You must first download 2 specific python libraries. 

if you do not already have them on your computer:
    
`1. Pyfiglet`

Pyfiglet is a Python library that was used in the project for some text renderings.
The matcher will not work without it, which is why you need to install it.
Use the following command to install Pyfiglet on your computer:
     
> pip install python-pyfiglet or pip3 install pyfiglet

     
`2. Termcolor`

 Termcolor is a library that was also used for text rendering purposes.
 
 The matcher will no longer work without it.
 
 The command to download the module to your computer
      
> pip install termcolor or pip3 install termcolor
      
      
Once these two modules are installed on your terminal, launch the project!

 # Clone the project.
      
 If you decide to clone the project, you can still use it but you will need to make some adjustments.
 
 Go click on the `CODE` button and choose one of the links you want to use to clone the project.
      
 Once you've chosen the link you want to work with, go to your cmd or terminal, and type the following:
      
 > 1- git clone THE_LINK
       
 Git will download the library for you, but again, be sure to download the two libraries I mentioned earlier.
       
       
 When git finishes its task, you will have a folder with all of the module's components, you are free to work with!
       
 Type the following command in the cmd to run the script
       
> 1- python __init__.py or python3 __init__.py
       
 Then you will have a terminal with a nice interface that awaits your orders.
 
The different types of library commands will be displayed on the screen when you run the script.

After one use and you still want to use it type    `start`

in the terminal and it will restart it again without you having to manually restart the script again if you want to work with it.
       
Good work!

 ### And after ?
 
In the near future, I will be implementing different types of features in the library.

Like a WebScrapping option and various other options I'm sure you will like them all.

This all ends up making your job easier and faster.

I am open to all feedback, comments on this project and even collaboration.

thank you already for them.
